Black-Scholes options price calculator

The Black-Scholes model is a financial model used to calculate the fair price or theoretical value for a European call or put option, using assumptions of constant volatility, no dividends, and efficient markets.
Developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes and Robert Merton in the early 1970s, the model provides a theoretical estimate of the price of European-style options. The Black-Scholes formula considers factors such as the current stock price, the option’s strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate and the asset’s volatility to calculate the option’s premium.

In this Python project, we will cover the following key areas:
1. Understanding the Black-Scholes formula and its components.
2. Fetching real options data using the yfinance library.
3. Implementing the Black-Scholes model in Python using an object-oriented approach.
4. Visualizing option prices and greeks with stunning plots.
5. Analyzing the sensitivity of option prices to various parameters.
